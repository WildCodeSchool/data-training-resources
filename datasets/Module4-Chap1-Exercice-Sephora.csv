It was my favorite serum. But recently they have changed the formula, and now it is, for me, completely unusable. I’m going to preface this by saying that once I found a good skincare routine, I stuck with it. I never changed ANYTHING, I just bought more of what I’d been using when I ran low.With the old formula, I had absolutely zero irritation and my skin was breakout free. It didn’t feel overly-sensitive, and the texture was nice. When I ran out of my last tube of the old formula, I bought a new one and you could immediately tell it was different. The consistency was sticky and sort of greasy, the color was off, and the scent was almost rancid. It used to smell sort of like maple syrup, and it used to feel really pleasant to apply in terms of consistency and a nice, warming sensation. The old formula soaked in quickly and didn’t leave a weird film on my skin. The new formula gave me a stinging, burning sensation on application, never completely absorbed and left my skin feeling sticky. By morning (I applied it before bed), my skin was super greasy, which never happened before. It was also red and splotchy, and felt irritated.After about week of hoping maybe it was something else - like I said, I loved this serum before - I started having breakouts all over my face and neck, which I had also not had an issue with before. I also had a constant itchy, burning feeling on my neck. Stopped using it and switched to another retinol (which was unfortunately not the reasonable price point of INKey) and my skin went back to normal. It’s legitimately no longer a good product.

It was like a 6-month process so I judged each product for a month at a time.  First started cleansing 2-3x a day.   Then morning sunscreen & nightime moisturizers.  Then added serums & eye serums under that.  Finally retinol last.  This product does complete cell turnover overnight.  You’ll wake up & go wow.  My skin is glowing.  After a week (used every other day) you’ll go oh my complexion has lightened & is evening out.  After a month all the little micro freckles & super old acne scars are gone & your skin is completely even.  My mom at the end of the month said my makeup looked good today.  Wasn’t wearing any! People at work said I had dewy skin.  I am 40 now & mentally went from the traumatized pizza-faced pimpled teenager to “dewy.”  That spoke volumes for me; this product rocks my socks.

Having said that, I do note that this is a more mild dosing of Retinol and there are others out there that are stronger, but your skin may take a “hit“ in that it might become reddened or peel or sting/burn when the product is applied; which is why I prefer this type of retinol serum. It works on one’s skin without the discomfort associated with many retinoids out there. I also appreciate the price point of the Inkey List’s products, as you can literally build an entire skin care routine from the ground up, and include two to three serums and/or treatment items as well. You can’t say that with many brands out there with the same types of products and get the same type of results. I am often asked “What do you use on your skin?“ I usually answer “Oh I use a few things from different lines.“ because I do, but it’s the products that perform that you tend to not reveal that much, as you want to keep those to yourself!This is one of those products, as it does work and you can recommend it to others knowing that it actually does something for your skin. At least for me, I can say “Yes“ I benefit from this particular serum.

That disclosure out of the way, part of the reason I purchased the retinol serum from The INKEY List is it’s in a closed container so there isn’t any product being exposed to the air and other elements. The price is also unreal and awesome. I like that it has that yellow/light orange color I’m familiar with when it comes to retinol serums. No irritation whatsoever on my skin, and I think a major part of this is because I’ve used retinol often in the past. I also think my skin is in pretty good condition for a nearly 40-year-old, so while I’m not seeing immediate results overnight, I have the peace of mind that I’m maintaining good skin as I do my best to age gracefully without seeking fillers, botox, etc (btw, you do you when it comes to cosmetic procedures! I don’t judge; I just choose the non-cosmetic procedure route for myself, at least at this point in my life). I like this product enough that I foresee purchasing it again once this runs out. I’m also curious about a few other products from this line because I’m satisfied with the efficacy of this retinol product.

I feel that the Inkey list is far superior in performance and stronger than the ToL one, I even feel it working throughout the day. I even received compliments on my skin after a few weeks of using it (even when wearing masks). Since I used this during Covid times, I rarely wore makeup and I felt this retinol product was an important part of my routine to look acceptable makeup-free. This may have softened and smoothed lines around my eyes. I also like the fact that a little dab of this stuff goes a long way (even spreadable down to my neck). Finally, the price is super awesome and affordable! For these reasons, I gave this product 5 stars.However, I do think that this retinol is a bit strong for people beginning with using retinol in their face routine. I can see this irritating skin new to retinol users, so I am happy to have used ToL as an introduction to retinol and then take it up notch with Inkey list. I don’t think I would have given this product 5 stars if I were new to retinol. The texture of this product is nice with a touch (I mean a super-light touch) of grittiness (that easily melts and gets into a smooth consistency after a few seconds in contact with my body heat). I am somewhat sensitive tactile-wise, so I do notice little things like this. In no way I’m saying that this product exfoliates; I still do use exfoliants in my routine. It also has a hint of sugar cane-like smell. It also looks like a bit of condensed milk.

In terms of how effective it is to treat hyperpigmentation and non-inflammatory acne. It does not improve hyperpigmentation as quickly as the 80 dollar-bottle one, probably due to the low retinol concentration. I am slightly disappointed by this mediocre result. However it does help with my non-inflammatory acne tremendously! what’s funny is that I started to develop those acnes after using INKEY’s collagen booster.

After using the retinol consistently at bed time for about 1.5months, all these non-inflammatory acnes are gone COMPLETELY!!!!!!! it took a while but being patient is the key as the retinol needs to work its way to accelerate the de-keratinization and exfoliating process.Bottom line from me: wonderful in treating non-inflammatory acne in 1.5 months after using daily.

What made it better in my eyes was that it’s also rated “clean by Sephora” so I also didn’t think much about checking the ingredient list like I do with literally everything else I put on my face. I just ordered my third bottle a couple of days ago and I went back to look at the ingredients because there was something in particular I wanted to check for. I don’t even remember what it was because to my dismay I saw high up on the list “dimethicone” which is the one ingredient that is always a deal breaker for me. I refuse to use any skincare products that contain silicones. Why? Silicones, to put it plainly, are essentially plastic. But even though some may argue (respectively) that silicones are okay because they prevent TEWL, I realized in more ways than one that it didn’t do much for my skin. 1) it would create a blurring effect for my forehead fine lines but as soon as I cleansed my skin the next day and patted dry, they would be right back to how they were before (and mind you, I’d been using it for a while now so this isn’t a one or two time try and review), and 2) I couldn’t figure out how my skin was suddenly so prone to clogged pores but now it all makes sense - the silicones sitting on top of my skin. So take that information however you want but personally, I’ll be way more careful about checking ingredient lists and after this one bottle arrives, I’m sending it right back to Sephora and buying retinol from a different brand.

Retinol is an amazing ingredient, but you need to know how it works and the beginning stages of it. As with all retinol products, you need to give your skin time to adapt to it. It’s best to ease your skin into it, but there will be some acne and flaky skin along the way. Start with spot treatment every other day, and work up to your entire face in about a two week time span. Retinol is a strong ingredient, but if you work your way through it the result is ABOSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!! I strongly suggest starting off with this retinol serum because it is very affordable, and if it doesn’t work out you won’t feel bad giving it away to a friend or family member. Please remember that acne may form, but that is because it is increasing your skin turnover rate. This means that it pushes out acne that is hiding under the skin.

I have a very sensitive, combination skin type that is acne prone. I’ve been in the dermatigists office since I was 9. To give you an idea of my skincare routine the past 10 years, I use a benzoyl peroxide wash at least 3 times a week, about the same amount of lactic acid per week (sometimes I’ll use clarisonic instead), retinol, and topical clindamycin. Obviously, these products are all VERY drying without a good moisturizer. I really like this product though because I tend to peel a lot (ew!) from the prescription retinol recently (guess my skin type changed a little with age now that I’m 23) but this stuff is definitely more gentle than any one I’ve ever used.I have tried both drug store retinols and high end retinols. I wanted to try something different because I still hadnt found one that was both affordable and gave solid results without crazy irritation. I didnt see the point in paying $80 for a retinol when it usually causes me to peel. (I know peeling is normal with retinol, but not if it doesnt improve. mine wouldnt with, i think, 1% products). I saw how quickly this has been selling out and have been in love with simple skin care lately, and I am very impressed already! This stuff is perfect for my skin so far because it easily absorbs and doesnt irritate my sensitive skin! it’s a little sticky at first, but it quickly disappears, especially after moisturizing. You definitely want to put this under your moisturizer tho as if you layer it on top it likely wouldn’t sink into your skin as well with a thicker product underneath. I still think a good moisturizer is important when using any retinol though, especially if you’re new to it, which is why I suggest using this as a serum prior to moisturizing.

It didn’t really have a scent to it that I noticed, which isn’t a bad thing! The serum absorbed into my skin quickly, leaving no trace behind of anything greasy or oily. I had to use it for about two weeks, but I started to notice a difference in the brightness of my skin and the overall lack of dullness that I’ve struggled with. I also noticed my age spots seemed lighter. They didn’t go away, but they were definitely less obvious and easier to hide with a little cover up.

It has a very mild scent that reminds me of lanolin. I washed and dried my face before applying a pea-sized amount to my face and neck. It absorbed right into my skin and felt hydrating, but as the instructions say, you need to apply moisturizer over it, so I applied my night cream over it. The first 2 nights it made my skin feel warm, but in a nice way, for about 5 minutes. After 2 days of use that sensation was gone. This product has made my skin feel extra soft and helped reduce the look of fine lines. I have mild rosacea and it actually seems to calm some of the redness for me.
